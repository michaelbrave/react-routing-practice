import React from 'react';

function Blog() {
  return (
    <div >
        <h1>Blog</h1>
        <p>
          This is a prototype for a simple blog, I will add more here later like a card based menu to select articles but for now this placeholder text will have to do.
        </p>
    </div>

export default Blog;
